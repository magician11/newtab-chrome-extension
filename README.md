# newtab-chrome-extension
An extension for Google Chrome that sets a photo as the background when a new tab is opened.

This is a starting place for those wanting to create a customised new tab in Google Chrome.

Very similar to [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) and [Wandertab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wandertab-by-hitlist/fobdcmnamenjmkffajcbljjpgiolooeh?hl=en).

This starter includes a background photo, a greeting and a quote.
